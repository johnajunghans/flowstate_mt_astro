"I believe in consciously cultivating a space within which there is no pressure to understand. 

Oftentimes, the pressure to understand something actually inhibits the process of understanding. We’re conditioned to “try” to understand, when in reality understanding happens of its own accord. For example, it is common for people to experience some previously difficult concept suddenly “clicking.” 

This does not mean that there isn’t an expectation that the student is working hard and trying their best. 

There is. This is something I take quite seriously. 

It’s simply that there is a deliberate relaxation of the restless need to understand something immediately. Understanding tends to blossom more quickly and more completely when there is less stress and pressure to understand."

Regardless of the subject being taught, I do my best to facilitate and expedite the studentâ€™s natural progression towards independence. Independence, in the context of scholastic endeavors typically involves doing a homework problem correctly with absolutely no assistance. This can often be a scary experience for many students who have a fear of failure (which is really a fear of rejection). In order to smooth the sometimes bumpy progression into independence, I utilize a very basic, tried and true method outlined below: 

1. I Do: I show the student an example problem with detailed explanations
2. We Do: I ask the student to do an example problem of their own but I make it clear that I am there to help and answer any questions.
3. You Do: I ask the student to do another example problem but this time make it clear that I am not going to give any feedback or assistance. I make it clear that failure (i.e. getting the question wrong) is completely normal and safe in the space of our session, and that we can review the problem in detail together if it is too challenging.

The time spent on each stage may vary, however, the goal of each and every session that I conduct is to get the student as close as possible to the final stage (You Do).
